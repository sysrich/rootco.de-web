<p>In the past I've posted <a href="/tech tips/2013/03/17/intel-power-management-on-opensuse-12-3.html">several</a> <a href="/tech tips/2012/07/16/reducing-laptop-power-consumption-on-opensuse-12-2-sandybridge.html">articles</a> on various tweaks to improve Power Management on Intel Sandy/Ivybridge hardware, based on my experiments with my Lenovo X220</p>
<p>With more recent releases of openSUSE, I've been experimenting with my old tweaks, and found that they NO LONGER help with power management - In fact, they seem to increase it</p>
<p>So, my advice at the moment - if you want a Linux OS that has good Power Management on a Lenovo X220 or similar laptop.. install openSUSE Tumbleweed, and don't change the default settings :)</p>
<p>HTH</p>
