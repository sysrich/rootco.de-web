<p>In the past I've posted <a href="https://sysrich.co.uk/?p=190">several</a> <a href="http://www.sysrich.co.uk/?p=92">articles</a> on various tweaks to improve Power Management on Intel Sandy/Ivybridge hardware, based on my experiments with my Lenovo X220</p>
<p>With more recent releases of openSUSE, I've been experimenting with my old tweaks, and found that they NO LONGER help with power management - In fact, they seem to increase it</p>
<p>So, my advice at the moment - if you want a Linux OS that has good Power Management on a Lenovo X220 or similar laptop.. install openSUSE Tumbleweed, and don't change the default settings :)</p>
<p>HTH</p>
