<p>Hello fellow Geekos!</p>
<p>After 10 months serving on the Board, my current tenure on the Board is<br />
due to end this year.</p>
<p>It's been a busy 10 months, during which time I've been involved in<br />
progressing the reform of the Ambassador/Advocate &amp; Local Coordinator<br />
Programmes, monitoring the improvements to the Travel support programme,<br />
countless copyright requests and much more besides, all while<br />
maintaining my contributions to other parts of the project as a regular<br />
Geeko (GNOME &amp; Branding in particular).</p>
<p>With all that said, there is lots more work that remains to be done,<br />
which is why I'm announcing my intention to stand for (re)election to<br />
the openSUSE Board</p>
<p>If you choose to re-elect me, my priority will be to continue to<br />
represent you all, our community of contributors, and to address the<br />
issues of greatest concern to you and our Project.<br />
I hope to encourage further empowerment of both the Board and the wider<br />
Community to take on responsibilities 'traditionally' held only by SUSE<br />
employees. I also wish to improve the working relationship between the<br />
Board and the openSUSE Team.</p>
<p>As you may already know, as of last week I have become a SUSE employee.<br />
As I am working in QA, my 'day job' will continue to have relatively<br />
little to do with openSUSE, but given that openSUSE has been my hobby<br />
and my passion for something like 7 years, I am not intending to let my<br />
new employment change how I serve this community; Though obviously being<br />
surrounded by so many of our contributors in Nuremberg will hopefully<br />
make it easier for me to hear what's of interest to you :)</p>
<p>I hope you trust me with your votes in a few weeks time.<br />
Thanks for all the fun,</p>
<p>Richard</p>
