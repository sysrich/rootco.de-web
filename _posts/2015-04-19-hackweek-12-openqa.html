  week. Every day the company sponsored Lunch or Breakfast, which got everyone together
  and triggered many interesting conversations. Some times we were serenaded by the

<p>Last week was SUSE's <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hackweek</a> 12.<br />
<a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hackweeks</a> are special weeks at SUSE where all of SUSE Engineering get to work on whatever they'd like, to try cool things and learn new stuff.</p>
<p>This Hackweek was my first at SUSE's Nuremberg office, and it was quite an experience. The whole place had a 'buzz' about it all week. Every day the company sponsored Lunch or Breakfast, which got everyone together and triggered many interesting conversations. Some times we were serenaded by the '<a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/12/projects/252">SUSE Band</a>' who were working on their <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/12/projects/252">musical abilities and technology for hackweek</a>.</p>
<p>I had lots of conversations about the upcoming <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15">openSUSE conference</a>, some of SUSE's planned projects around openSUSE, and of course openQA, which was a big part of lots of peoples Hackweek.</p>
<p>Bernhard Wiedemann worked on <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/12/projects/812">adding subtitles to openQA's video recordings</a> so users can see what openQA is doing when it produces the recorded screen output.</p>
<p>Max Lin worked on a <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/12/projects/820">chrome extension to provide live status monitoring of an openQA instance and its workers</a>.</p>
<p>Bernhard, Stephan Kulow, and Klaus Kämpf looked at getting openQA to test bare metal hardware.<br />
While openQA already has support for IPMI for bare metal testing of servers, pushing the already established limits is exactly the spirit of Hackweek :)<br />
Bernhard started experimenting with the idea of using ARM development boards to emulate a keyboard and relay openQAs keyboard commands. Next Hackweek he hopes to have a HDMI grabber so it will be able to see the video output also.<br />
Klaus and Coolo were successful in getting openQA to control hardware with Intel vPro/AMT (as found in Thinkpads and other common laptop/desktop hardware). This <a href="http://stephan.kulow.org/amt.ogv">demonstration video shows it working on my very own X220 Thinkpad</a>.</p>
<p>And Xudong Zhang from Beijing and myself worked on testing openQA by using openQA</p>
<h4>Testing openQA on openQA, are you crazy?</h4>
<p>Actually, only a little crazy.<br />
We made life easy for ourselves by creating two disk images (one for SLES 12 and another for openSUSE 13.2) to represent the same production environments we have for <a title="http://openqa.opensuse.org" href="http://openqa.opensuse.org">http://openqa.opensuse.org</a> and the internal SUSE openQA instance.</p>
<p>These images were created following the regular <a href="http://os-autoinst.github.io/openQA/documentation/">openQA Documentation</a> and setup to test a 'known good' Distribution with a static set of tests (openSUSE 13.2 with the tests and needles from <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst">our GitHub project</a>)</p>
<p>We then configured openQA to treat this disk image as a different 'distribution', and we wrote new tests for testing openQA (See the source code <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-openQA">HERE</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of 'needling' later (Capturing the reference screenshots and defining the areas of interest to openQA, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-needles-openQA">HERE</a>) we had a working test run which was able to test openQA running on openSUSE 13.2</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdgaItRe9Kg">YouTube</a></p>
<p>and also for testing openQA on SLES 12</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPScqm3iMSk">YouTube</a></p>
<p>These tests successfully test all the core functionality of openQA, including Upgrading from the official OBS repository, Confirming the Worker is running, Scheduling an openQA job from the shell, Confirming a Job is running from the shell, and checking the functionality of each of the UI Screens by loading up Firefox and clicking on all of the links just like a user would.</p>
<p>With this development, we now have a way of confirming that new builds of openQA are safe for deployment in production, which should help us be a little more fearless and rapid updating the openQA versions in use for testing openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise, even when during heavy testing periods.</p>
<p>Expect to see these tests running on the public <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org">http://openqa.opensuse.org </a>soon.. I just need to figure out an elegant way of triggering them automatically as soon as OBS has new RPMs for testing.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who made this Hackweek awesome!</p>
