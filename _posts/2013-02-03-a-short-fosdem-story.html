<p>Phew! FOSDEM was great this year. Just like last, I was there as part of a huge openSUSE showing.</p>
<p>I plan on writing a full report, but here's a short anecdote that really sums up why FOSDEM is such a great event and openSUSE is such an awesome project.</p>
<p>Early in the morning on the second day, we're setting up our booth when a gentleman comes over. He's an openSUSE user, and is broadly happy, but he brings up an area we are weak in - when installing packages on openSUSE, users have no way of knowing when its avoided configuration files and instead made rpmnew files.</p>
<p>These rpmnew files are normally really useful, often containing new defaults, new parameters and new comments, all of which might be of use to a sysadmin who wants to keep their openSUSE box running as trim as possible.</p>
<p>I thought the idea of doing something about that was awesome, so I open up openFATE on the demo machine (<a href="http://features.opensuse.org">http://features.opensuse.org</a>) and throw the mans problem down as a feature request. He leaves our booth with a big smile.</p>
<p>Later that day I'm talking to <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:-miska-">Michal Hrušecký</a> , a SUSE guy who also does a lot with gentoo. His eyes light up as I'm explaining the situation to him "etc-update! Gentoo has a tool to do that, maybe we can port that?". </p>
<p>Before lunch he had his port written and built in the <a href="http://build.opensuse.org">Open Build Service</a>, and he soon had it installed on the ARM Chromebook running openSUSE at the booth.</p>
<p>I've given it a pretty good testing and there are no major issues, its almost certain to make it as a new package for openSUSE 13.1. </p>
<p>From feature idea to working package in a few hours all from the FOSDEM conference floor - with a solution that crosses over from one FOSS project to another.<br />
Stuff like this is why I love open source.</p>
<p>Mystery man whose name I forgot to take, thank you, your idea has gone far, fast, I hope you like it when its in openSUSE 13.1</p>
