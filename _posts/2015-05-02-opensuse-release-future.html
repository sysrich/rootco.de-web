<p>The recording of my presentation from openSUSE conference 2015 is live.</p>
<p>During the session I talk about the success of Tumbleweed and how its the best choice for anyone who wants their Linux with the latest and greatest software</p>
<p>I then go on to talk about our openSUSE Regular Release, where I propose using the recently released SUSE Linux Enterprise sources as an opportunity to build a Stable Linux release that covers the needs of more conservative users as successfully as Tumbleweed covers the needs of those who want new versions of everything, regularly</p>
