<p>They did it! openSUSE Conference 2013 was our first <strong>Community Organised</strong> conference, put together by our amazing 'Greeko' Greek openSUSE community.</p>

<p>Thanks to the whole team for making the event a success, and a special thanks to <strong>Kostas</strong> and <strong>Stella </strong>for taking the lead throughout</p>
<p>It was a great event, with over 250 attendees, more than we were expecting.<br />
I think we really got the 'balance' right, with a good mix of both community and technical orientated talks, as well as decent spaces to sit down and hack or discuss ideas. It was great to see both a lot of old faces and a whole bunch of new ones. It's really got me excited about the progress our project is making.<img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://news.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0544.jpg" width="6000" height="4000" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv">Every single talk was recorded and is now available on YouTube</a>, including my talks on the new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lsC2XmSloM">Local Coordinator Programme</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKQLHbZUrXM">Branding/Themeing openSUSE</a>.</p>
<p>I particually liked the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdroo2JZano">2nd Day Keynote from Ralf Flaxa</a>, where he did a great job explaining the importance of openSUSE to SUSE, the successes we have together, and also the challenges we share, especially 'The Gap' created by openSUSE's rapid pace of change which can create difficulties from both sides when SUSE need to 'catch up' every few years for their SUSE Enterprise Distribution. I'm interested in seeing the discussion develop over the coming months about how both openSUSE and perhaps SLE can evolve to negate the problems of 'The Gap' without losing the essence of what makes both distributions special and unique from each other.</p>
<p>If you didn't get to go, I'd recommend browsing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/opensusetv">openSUSEtv YouTube Channel</a>, there's lots of good stuff there. I'll certainly be doing that, as I didn't get to see as many of the talks as I'd like, as me and the rest of the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board">openSUSE Board</a> were kept busy with plenty of meetings, but they were productive and that is good too. I'm looking forward to many of the ideas discussed at oSC baring fruit over the next few months.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program">openSUSE Travel Support Programme</a> for making it possible for me to attend, I hope to see everyone again at<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2013/07/21/opensuse-conference-2013-2nd-day/"> oSC 14 in Dubrovnik</a></p>
