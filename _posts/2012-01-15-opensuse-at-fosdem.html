<p><a title="FOSDEM 2012" href="http://fosdem.org/2012/">FOSDEM 2012</a> is nearly upon us, and once again openSUSE is going to be there in force.</p>
<p>Our stand is going to be on the <strong>Ground Floor</strong> of <strong>Building K</strong> from 9am on Saturday 4th February till 6pm on Sunday 5th February</p>
<p>As well as demonstrating <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:12.1">openSUSE 12.1</a>, we hope to be showing off the latest successes from the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM">openSUSE ARM Team</a></p>
<p>We're planning on having DVDs to give away, and T-Shirts, Beer and who knows what else to 'sell' for donations, with all proceeds going back to the FOSDEM organisers as a thank you for hosting this great event.</p>
<p>We've already got a number of volunteers to help with the booth, but we could still do with more - we're expecting it to be really busy.</p>
<p>If you'd like to lend a hand, either drop a message here, or email me at <a href="mailto:RBrownCCB@opensuse.org">RBrownCCB@opensuse.org</a> , or just turn up on the day and pitch in.</p>
<p>The openSUSE community will not just be there at the booth though, if you take a at the great <a href="http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/days">schedule posted on the FOSDEM site</a> you'll spot several talks, sessions &amp; devrooms that will have openSUSE people taking part.</p>
<p>Hope to see many of you there in a few weeks!</p>
