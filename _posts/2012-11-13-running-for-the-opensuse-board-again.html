<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I guess I'm a sucker for punishment - after having such fun last year, </span>I'm announcing my intent to run for the openSUSE Board in this years Board Elections</p>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I've been using SUSE Linux since 2003 and contributing to openSUSE since the Project started.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I've got my hands dirty in many aspects of the project, from testing, packaging, working on branding and artwork, to providing support on IRC. I currently work mostly in the GNOME, Marketing, and Ambassador teams, and have previously worked on the Artwork team.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I'm an active Ambassador, who regularly attends conferences where I do my best to to both evangelise about our great project, but also gather ideas and feedback on how we could improve. I've been involved in the efforts to reshape the Ambassador programme into something more useful for openSUSE</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">My current 'day job' is as a Systems Manager for a college in the south of the UK which uses a great deal of Linux and FOSS technologies, including openSUSE.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">Through that job, I currently hold a Board Member position of the TTP User Group, which consists of sysadmins of hundreds of Colleges internationally, all using SUSE/Novell/NetIQ products.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">If I am elected to the board, my intention is to be an enthusiastic and active Board member.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I want to see our community grow in both numbers and activity. We need to be more vocal about our strengths, and most honest about our weaknesses.<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I think we need to improve communication across the community, and I'd like to see the Board take a more active role in resolving any disputes. </span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">I'd also like to see the Board stepping up to engage the community in helping out to address deficiencies or weaknesses in the project. I don't want to see the board starting to meddle in the affairs of development, but I do think situations like the delays to 12.1 could have been helped by having a board that is willing to speak up and call for the community to help out.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">So when the Ballots open in a few weeks, please consider voting for me, I promise to do my best if I am elected.</span></div>
