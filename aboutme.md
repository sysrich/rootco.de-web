Hello! I'm Richard. This is my blog to comment about stuff related to my contributions to the <a title="openSUSE" href="http://www.openSUSE.org">openSUSE project</a>, my work for <a href="http://www.suse.com">SUSE Linux</a>, and occationally my other hobby of Photography.

I've used SUSE/openSUSE since 2003, finding myself helping out more and more as time went on.

In 2013 I joined SUSE to work as a QA Engineer & Technical Lead for [openQA](http://openqa.opensuse.org)   
Since 2017, I now work as a Linux Distribution Engineer in SUSE's Future Technology Team, working on various distribution projects including [Kubic](https://kubic.opensuse.org)   
I was previously Chairman of the openSUSE Project from 2014 until 2019.

I've done most work with openSUSE's <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:GNOME">GNOME</a>, <a title="openSUSE Marketing" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Marketing">Marketing</a>, and <a title="openSUSE Artwork" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Artwork">Artwork</a> teams, and generally causing trouble by trying to fix things wherever I think I can.

I also spend a lot of time in <a title="openSUSE IRC Channels" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:IRC_list">openSUSE's IRC channels</a> on irc.freenode.org under the name sysrich (formerly ilmehtar)
