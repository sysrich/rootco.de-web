Hello! I'm Richard. This is my blog to comment about stuff related to my contributions to the <a title="openSUSE" href="http://www.openSUSE.org">openSUSE project</a>, my work for <a href="http://www.suse.com">SUSE Linux</a>, and occationally my other hobby of Photography.

I am currently a Distributions Architect at SUSE, where I have worked in various roles since 2013, including QA Engineer, Technical Lead for openQA, and Linux Distribution Engineer.

I've used SUSE/openSUSE since 2003, finding myself helping out more and more as time went on.

I've been intimately involved in many of openSUSE's most interesting projects over the years, including Evergreen, Leap, Tumbleweed, MicroOS and Kubic. I had the pleasure of being the openSUSE Project's Chairperson from 2014 until 2019.

Most recently, I founded the MicroOS Desktop project, now known as [openSUSE Aeon](https://aeondesktop.org).

I've done most work with openSUSE's <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:GNOME">GNOME</a>, <a title="openSUSE Marketing" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Marketing">Marketing</a>, and <a title="openSUSE Artwork" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Artwork">Artwork</a> teams, and generally causing trouble by trying to fix things wherever I think I can.

I also spend a lot of time in <a title="openSUSE IRC Channels" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:IRC_list">openSUSE's IRC channels</a> on irc.freenode.org under the name sysrich (formerly ilmehtar)
